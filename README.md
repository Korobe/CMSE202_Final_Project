# CMSE202_Final_Project
This is a project based on mapping viral data on different college campuses by
Garrit Hotchkiss, Isabel Petrescu, Jacob Marquez, and Benjamin Johnson.

In order to run this project all you have to do is download the jupyter
notebook, open it in through anaconda, and run all of the cells.
